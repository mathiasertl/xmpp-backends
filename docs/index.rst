Welcome to xmpp-backends's documentation!
=========================================

**xmpp-backends** is a small library providing a consinstent interface to
various APIs offered by XMPP servers. This allows software to be agnostic to an
XMPP server it uses.

This software is used e.g. by `jabber.at <https://jabber.at>`_ to provide
registration and account management services.
